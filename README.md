Tired of lasting the entire game on a single tank of oxygen? Perhaps this mod is for you.

This mod increases the rate of oxygen consumption by 12 times. It also increases the oxygen storage capacity of your suit by 12 times. 

The consequence is that a full refill will last the same amount of time, but will use more oxygen.

A full refill of suit oxygen will use approximately 1% of a large grid oxygen tank.
